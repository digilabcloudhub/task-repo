ATM Machine Solution

Below are few points of the solutions.

1. Applications contain two endpoint
    a. atm/balance
    b. atm/withdrawal
    
2. Application can be started by using java -jar target/atm-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

3. Test coverage for services is above 80%
 
4. InMemory Database can be accessed at localhost:8080/h2-console/login.jsp

5. I have tried to cover all edge cases and validations.

6. Dockerfile is created in the application.

7. All the api's are validated through postman.


Note: Dockerfile cannot be validated on local due to local docker setup issue on windows.
